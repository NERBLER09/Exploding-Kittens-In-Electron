# Exploding Kittens In Electron - Svelte Rewrite
This is where the the Exploding Kittens In Electron Svelte rewrite is happening.

With the rewrite the Windows Store build will be discontinued, Exploding Kittens In Electron will be available on Flathub and the Snap Store on Linux. For more information check out `svelte-rewrite/readme.md`.

The original jQuery will remain until the rewrite is complete, which then it will move to a separate repo.

The reason of the rewrite is to make the jQuery code base more manageable, as well and to convert the code base to something I have more experience with.
